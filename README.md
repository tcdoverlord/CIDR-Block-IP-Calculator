CIDR Block IP Calculator
Overview
The CIDR Block IP Calculator is a simple and user-friendly web application designed to calculate the total number of IP addresses and usable IPs in a given CIDR block. It is particularly useful for understanding subnetting and IP allocation in IPv4 addressing, especially in contexts like Amazon VPCs.
Features
•	Input Validation: Ensures the CIDR block value is between /16 and /28.
•	IP Calculation: Computes total IP addresses, reserved IPs, and usable IPs for a CIDR block.
•	Dynamic Explanation: Displays detailed calculations and the formula used for better understanding.
•	User-Friendly Design: A clean and modern interface with responsive styling.
